# SelfieAI
This program generates selfies of me and my friend according to a text prompt. The output is (hopefully) close to the prompt, though this is up to the text encoder of the model I use. The base model being used is Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD1.5), with RealisticVision fine-tuning the model for photorealistic images. Since photorealistic images is a wide category, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) will be used to train the model to generate pictures of me and my friend, taken in a selfie style on a typical mobile phone camera.

## Plans for the Future
My original idea was an AI that could generate selfies of any two people so long as images of them were provided. But in my research I found out that training this model would require me to gather reference images of hundreds, maybe thousands of people. I don't have the capability for that so I downsized the program to just me and my friend as a proof of concept, but I do hope to implement my original idea someday. If that happens, it would be sick to get it deployed on the web, free for anyone to use. I'd use a cloud GPU to handle all the heavy processing so that any device can use SelfieAI. I have 0 experience with AI/ML, so I'm going to focus on learning about its inner working. Good thing SD1.5 is open-source cus my minimum wage job ain't paying for no subscription.
